### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is **Andreas** and I program and develop back-end applications with some front-end _scattered_ in some places.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ“· Iâ€™m currently working on Photogrophy and Programming
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Angular, Vue
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Plugins and bots
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about jobs regarding Development or more
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Discord | A9qx#7198
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Every Android app is a Java application, sadly
